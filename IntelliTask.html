                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><em>IntelliTask</em> is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) process/service manager. Running in the Microsoft Windows environment, its use is governed by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License v3.0</a>. <em>IntelliTask</em> is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, <em>IntelliTask</em> is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment. I hope you enjoy <em>IntelliTask</em> as much as I enjoy coding it!</p>

                    <p><em>IntelliTask</em> provides information about processes and services running on your computer. It also displays the most commonly used performance measures for processes. You can use <em>IntelliTask</em> to monitor key indicators of your computer&#8217;s performance. You can see the status of the programs that are running and end programs that have stopped responding. You can also assess the activity of running processes using as many as fifteen parameters, and see graphs and data on CPU and memory usage. In addition, if you are connected to a network, you can view network status and see how your network is functioning.</p>

                    <h2>Getting started</h2>
                    <h3>Install IntelliTask using the installer</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the installer</li>
                        <li>Run the executable binary and follow the installation flow</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The installer will likely require Administrative privileges in order to install <em>IntelliTask</em> (and later, to update <em>IntelliTask</em> or install or update plugins, or anything else that requires writing to the installation directory). If you do not have Administrative privileges, you either need to tell the installer to use a location where you do have write permission (though that may still ask for Administrator privileges), or you may choose not use the installer and instead run a portable edition from a directory where you have write permission.</p>
                    <h3>Install IntelliTask from zip</h3>
                    <p>These instructions will allow you to run a portable or mini-portable (also called “minimalist”), without requiring administrative privileges.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a new folder somewhere that you have write-permission</li>
                        <li>Unzip the content into the new folder</li>
                        <li>Run <em>IntelliTask</em> from the new folder</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The portable zip edition of <em>IntelliTask</em> can be removed by deleting the directory they came in. If you manually set up file associations or context-menu entries in the OS, it is your responsibility to remove them yourself.</p>

                    <h2>Create and Submit your Pull Request</h2>
                    <p>As noted in the <a href="https://github.com/mihaimoga/IntelliTask/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Contributing Rules</a> for <em>IntelliTask</em>, all Pull Requests need to be attached to a issue on GitHub. So the first step is to create an issue which requests that the functionality be improved (if it was already there) or added (if it was not yet there); in your issue, be sure to explain that you have the functionality definition ready, and will be submitting a Pull Request. The second step is to use the GitHub interface to create the Pull Request from your fork into the main repository. The final step is to wait for and respond to feedback from the developers as needed, until such time as your PR is accepted or rejected.</p>
